# Max_Throughput
Implementation of an algorithm for finding the optimal power allocation for different systems/nodes in a distributed computer network system.
* First Assumption:
  - If the difference between the new power and the old power obtained is greater than the convergence threshold value(Îµ), then the new power is assigned to the old power

## Assumptions for the initial implementation:
* Assumption:
  - Here, in the first implementation of the algorithm, we have considered that the values for average internal channel gain(g<sub>ii</sub>) and the value for the external channel gain(g<sub>ij</sub>) are initially given
